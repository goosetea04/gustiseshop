### Reflection 1
1. For my code, I believe I have not set up the environment to be 100% correct. For most of my methods, variables, and so on, I gave them meaningful names that will hopefully make the reader easily understand what each code is supposed to be. I believe the functions I employed are effective in the sense that they are properly named and mostly serve one function. When it comes to comments, I believe I have not given it my all here. The comments I wrote for this module were only written when I 'felt' like it. I know that is not good practice and will be sure to improve in the future. Moving onto secure coding practices, I believe I have not implemented that many secure coding practices. I believe the only practice I employed was testing everything correctly as I went on. My code as a whole I believe can be so much better. I need to get the hang of writing tests mostly, whether it be unit or functional, I hope that I can write better and easier-to-understand code in the future.

### Reflection 2
1. After Writing the unit test, I felt relieved that the tests I wrote ran. I am not sure if I met all the specifications required in the module. I hope that with more time I can get to better understand tests and implement them in my code. Regarding testing itself, I think the number of tests depends on the features of the app. It is better for the app and development if all the features of the unit test are written. This I believe is code coverage, the percentage of the source code that is tested. 100% code coverage does not ensure the program is free of bugs. The features may work by themselves but have bigs when interacting with each other. This is a disadvantage of unit tests.
2. For this question I seem to have misread the exercise and did both item and quantity for my test. If I were to have made just the product name and I needed to find the quantity in the test, I would change the `productNameInput.sendKeys();` to be the quantity and change the element to `By.id("quantityInput")`. I would make the same changes for reading and verifying. I think the code won't get messier. It will stay relatively clean

### Reflection 1

When I initially ran pmd.yml that gave me the log with errors, there was just one code quality issue I fixed. I fixed the unused import `org.springframework.boot.Banner` in `ProductController.java`. After I deployed the website, I fixed the remaining quality issues. I first noticed that there is unused import `org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*`. I thought it would be easy of a fix to just erase it. I then saw that 5 methods used it actually, so the issue was the `*` that was importing eveything else that wasn't used. I fixed it by replacing the `*` with the 5 methods that I know I am using in the file. These are `RequestMapping`, `GetMapping`, `PostMapping`, `ModelAttribute`, `PathVariable`. Next, I saw that in `ProductService.java`, there is a redundancy regarding the `public` tage since the interface is already public. I fixed this by removing `public` from the methods in the interface. AFter I made these changes, I checked the log generated by `pmd.yml` again and I saw that these issues are resolved.
