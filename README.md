### Reflection 1
1. For my code, I believed I have not really set up the environment to be 100% correct. For most of my methods, variables and so on, I gave them meaningful names that will hopefully make the reader easily understand about what each code is supposed to be. I believe the functions I employed are effective in the sense that they are properly named and mostly serve one function. When it comes to comments, I believe I have not given it my all here. The comments I wrote for this module are only written when I 'felt' like it. I know that is not good practice and will be sure to improve in the future. Moving onto secure coding practices, I believe I have not really implemented that many secure coding practices. I believe the only practice I employed was testing everything correctly as I went on. My code as a whole I believe can be so much better. I really need to get the hang of writing tests mostly, whether it be unit or functional, I hope that I can write better and easier-to-understand code in the future.

# Reflection 2
1. After Writing the unit test, I felt relieved that the tests I wrote ran. I am not sure if I met all the specifications required in the module. I hope that with more time I can get to better underrstand tests and implement them in my code. Regarding testing itself, I think the number of tests depends on the features in the app. It is better for the app and for development if all the features of the unit test are written. This I believe is code coverage, the percentage of the source code that is tested. 100% code coverage does not ensure the program is free of bugs. The features may work by themselves, but have bigs when interacting with each other. This is a disadvantage of unit tests.
2. For this question I seem to have misread the exercise and did both item and quantity for my test. If I were to have made just the product name and I need to find the quantity in the test, I would change the `productNameInput.sendKeys();` to be the quantity and change the element to `By.id("quantityInput")`. I would do the same changes for reading and verifying. I think the code won't get messier. It will stay relatively clean
